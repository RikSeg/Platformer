# A Small Platformer demo project made with Godot
A simple Platformer game project using GdScript language (Godot's own scripting language)

## What is Godot?
Godot engine is a Open Source Game Engine that lets you develop 2d and 3d games, animations, scenarios, etc. with ease.

## What is a Game Engine?
A game engine Ã­s a Software that make the development of games easier, since some functions are pre-made and much simpler to produce better games without worrying about a lot of programming. there are some functions in Godot that already make virtual character cams, collision, area of effect, gravity, character movement, controller support, etc.

## Why use GdScript?
Not only because it's the original godot's language, but also because it's a easy-to-learn language. (Godot supports other languages as well, like C#, Python, etc.)

## How did you made a github commit from Godot?
Godot has a Github Extension that let you sync the github repo to an local project, instead of using git bash (still, sometimes the bash is better, since the file selection in the extension is a bit odd...)

Since this is just a small demo, it might be the testing ground for some new projects in the future
